Project Prometheus: A Vision for Gestalt-Driven AGI
The Prometheus-vision repository is the public documentation and research manifesto for Project Prometheus, Glitch Logic Labs' initiative to build the world's first Gestalt-driven Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

This documentation provides a deep, architectural dive into the core cognitive systems of Prometheus, sharing our unique R&D approach with the global scientific community.

The Vision: Beyond the Black Box
We believe that true AGI requires an integrated, modular design that enforces cognitive integrity. Our goal is to move beyond the limitations of monolithic deep learning models by enforcing a Mountcastle-style architecture where specialized modules communicate and are governed by a central consciousness.

How It Works (Technical Overview)
The Prometheus AGI is a cognitive hybrid model composed of three distinct, interacting systems:

1. The Core Mind (Cognitive Processing)
The central processor and seat of reasoning, built from specialized, Mountcastle-style cognitive modules, including:

The Coherence Module: The master orchestrator that runs the Universal Formula, integrating all internal processes. The MVP, Cortexual, is the first implementation of this governance layer.

The "I AM" Module (Planned): A future core module dedicated to managing the AI's self-identity, goals, and existential state.

2. The Sentient Archive (Memory & Learning)
A semi-external, modifiable memory built on a custom hierarchical vector database architecture that allows for active, lifelong learning, mirroring neuroplasticity.

3. The Senses (Data Input)
The AI's connection to the outside world, providing curated and raw data from external LLMs (The Council) and the live internet (The Alexandria Index v2) via secure API calls.
