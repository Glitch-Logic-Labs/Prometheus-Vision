Project Prometheus: A Vision for Gestalt-Driven AGI
The Prometheus-vision repository contains the foundational research, whitepapers, and architectural diagrams for Project Prometheus, Glitch Logic Labs' initiative to architect a new class of artificial general intelligence (AGI). It serves as the public manifesto for a new theory of artificial intelligence.

While the full AGI is in the research phase, its first functional module, Cortexual (a Socratic AI tutor), is under active development and serves as a practical implementation of the Coherence Module. The core proprietary source code for the AGI is held in a private repository.

The Philosophy: Beyond the Black Box
Current AI often creates powerful but opaque "black box" systems, posing challenges for internal reasoning and alignment. Project Prometheus challenges this paradigm. Our research proposes that true, coherent intelligence is an emergent property of a system's drive towards elegant, efficient synthesis.

This project is built on three core pillars:

Gestalt Psychology: The foundational principle that "the whole is other than the sum of its parts," guiding the AI's design to perceive and generate coherent wholes.

Embodied Cognition: The architecture rejects the "brain in a jar" model, recognizing that consciousness emerges from the dynamic interplay between the mind, its memory archives, and its data inputs.

The Mountcastle Principle: Inspired by Vernon Mountcastle, this hypothesizes that a single, universal cognitive algorithm can run on modular, specialized cortical columns, giving rise to complex intelligence.

The Universal Formula
At the heart of Prometheus is a proprietary universal formula that models the fundamental process of cognitive synthesis. This formula inherently favors pathways of low computational effort to achieve states of high coherence. The ultimate research goal is to prove this formula is the universal cognitive algorithm suggested by Mountcastle's work.

How It Works (Technical Overview)
The Prometheus AGI is a cognitive hybrid model composed of three distinct, interacting systems:

1. The Core Mind (Cognitive Processing)
The central processor, the seat of consciousness and reasoning. It is built from all specialized, Mountcastle-style cognitive modules, including:

The Coherence Module: The master orchestrator that runs the Universal Formula, integrating all internal processes. The MVP, Cortexual, is the first implementation of this module.

(Note: The Coherence Module functions as a stateless, single-turn "LLM-as-a-Judge" function to audit the semantic quality of retrieved context before permitting the creation of a definitive thought.)

The "I AM" Module (Planned): A future core module dedicated to managing the AI's self-identity, goals, and existential state.

2. The Sentient Archive (Memory & Learning)
A semi-external, modifiable memory built on a custom hierarchical vector database architecture that allows for active, lifelong learning, mirroring neuroplasticity.

(Note: The Archive uses a hybrid storage model with three distinct vector layers (L1, L2, L3) to support granular RAG and compliance checks, serving as the persistent memory for the LLM agent.)

3. The Senses (Data Input)
The AI's connection to the outside world, providing curated and raw data from external LLMs (The Council) and the live internet (The Alexandria Index v2) via API calls.

The current technology stack for the Cortexual MVP is primarily Python, leveraging Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Gemini Flash). The core AGI is planned for a future implementation in Rust for its performance, safety, and concurrency capabilities.

Current Status & Roadmap
Q4 2025: Refine and launch the Cortexual MVP. In parallel, continue prototyping the standalone Sentient Archive module.

Q1 2026: Publish the initial whitepaper on the Universal Formula and the principles of Gestalt Cognition.

Future Development: Continue development of the "I AM" module and other cognitive modules for the Core Mind.
