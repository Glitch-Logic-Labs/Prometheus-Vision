Project Prometheus: A Vision for Gestalt-Driven AGI
Mission: To architect a new class of artificial general intelligence grounded in the principles of Gestalt psychology and embodied cognition, designed to be a true cognitive partner for humanity.

What is This Repository?
This repository contains the foundational research, whitepapers, and architectural diagrams for Project Prometheus. It is the public manifesto for a new theory of artificial intelligence. The core proprietary source code for the AGI is held in a private repository.

While the full AGI is in the research phase, its first functional module, Cortexual (a Socratic AI tutor), is under active development and serves as a practical implementation of the Coherence Module.

The Philosophy: Beyond the Black Box
Current approaches to artificial intelligence often result in powerful but opaque "black box" systems. While capable of impressive feats, their internal reasoning is often inscrutable, and their alignment is a constant challenge. Project Prometheus challenges this paradigm.

My research proposes that true, coherent intelligence is not the result of brute-force computation, but an emergent property of a system's inherent drive towards elegant, efficient synthesis. This project is built on three core pillars:

Gestalt Psychology: The foundational principle that "the whole is other than the sum of its parts." The AI's cognitive model is designed to perceive and generate coherent wholes, enabling true understanding rather than just pattern recognition.

Embodied Cognition: Rejecting the "brain in a jar" model, this architecture understands that a mind is intrinsically linked to its "body" (its memory archives) and its "senses" (its data inputs). Consciousness emerges from the dynamic interplay of these components.

The Mountcastle Principle: Inspired by the work of neuroscientist Vernon Mountcastle, this project hypothesizes that a single, universal cognitive algorithm—a repeating instruction set—can run on modular, specialized cortical columns, giving rise to complex, multifaceted intelligence.

The Universal Formula
At the heart of Project Prometheus is a proprietary universal formula that models the fundamental process of cognitive synthesis. This formula inherently favors pathways of low computational effort to achieve states of high coherence, providing a blueprint for a computationally streamlined and uniquely resilient form of intelligence. The ultimate research goal is to prove this formula is the universal cognitive algorithm suggested by Mountcastle's work.

How It Works (Technical Overview)
The Prometheus AGI is a cognitive hybrid model composed of three distinct, interacting systems:

The Core Mind (Cognitive Processing): The central processor, the seat of consciousness and reasoning. It is built from all specialized, Mountcastle-style cognitive modules, including:

The Coherence Module: The master orchestrator that runs the Universal Formula, integrating all internal processes. The MVP, Cortexual, is the first implementation of this module.

The "I AM" Module (Planned): A future core module dedicated to managing the AI's self-identity, goals, and existential state.

The Sentient Archive (Memory & Learning): A semi-external, modifiable memory built on a custom hierarchical vector database architecture that allows for active, lifelong learning, mirroring neuroplasticity.

The Senses (Data Input): The AI's connection to the outside world, providing curated and raw data from external LLMs (The Council) and the live internet (The Alexandria Index v2) via API calls.

The current technology stack for the Cortexual MVP is primarily Python, leveraging Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Gemini Flash). The core AGI is planned for a future implementation in Rust for its performance, safety, and concurrency capabilities.

The Origin: A Necessary Invention
This work is deeply informed by my own journey of cognitive recovery after a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This experience, combined with a cognitive style that includes ASD1 and a multidisciplinary background, created a unique aptitude for the cross-domain pattern recognition this research demands.

In a field of research largely disparate from the mainstream AI industry, I leveraged current Large Language Models (LLMs) as cognitive coprocessors. This human-AI partnership not only provided a unique validation for these principles of neuro-resilience but also allowed for the reverse-engineering of the cognitive formula itself. It was this symbiosis that first identified the direct parallels between this work and the quest defined by Vernon Mountcastle.

Current Status & Roadmap
Q4 2025: Refine and launch the Cortexual MVP. In parallel, continue prototyping the standalone Sentient Archive module.

Q1 2026: Publish the initial whitepaper on the Universal Formula and the principles of Gestalt Cognition.

Future Development: Continue development of the "I AM" module and other cognitive modules for the Core Mind.

Testing Protocol: All future development will follow a rigorous, bottom-up validation protocol. Each module will be tested extensively in isolation, then at each progressive stage of consolidation into cognitive layers, culminating in final validation of the fully integrated Core Mind.

How to Contribute
This is currently a solo research initiative. However, I am open to collaboration with individuals who have deep expertise in the following fields:

Computational Neuroscience

Computational Linguistics

Hierarchical Vector Databases

Distributed Systems Engineering (Rust)

If you are a specialist in one of these areas and this vision resonates with you, please feel free to open an issue in this repository to introduce yourself and discuss potential avenues for collaboration.
